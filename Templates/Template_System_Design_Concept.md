# System Design Concept
This template describes the structure of a system design concept. The system design concept describes the overall technical architecture of the digital solution. 
## Goals
This section decribes the goals that the technical system shall achieve as part of the digital solutions. The goals shall detail the vision of the digital solution in a way, that technical people understand what the technical system shall do as part of the overall value creation architecture.
## System Architecture
The system architecture describes the overall architecture of the technical system. The system architecture can consist of the following element types:
- User type: a human user that will use one or more elements of the technical system
- Softwareelement: a piece of software that performs certain functionalities for the user as part of the system (e.g. a smartphone app for the customer or a server element for storing data or providing backend functions). the software element will later be detailed in an element design concept.
- Hardwareelement: a piece of hardware that is necessary for operating a software element (e.g. a smartphone for a smartphone app or a server for running a server element)
- Partnerelement: a existing element that belongs to a partner of the digital solution (e.g. the paypal system for payment or the logistic system of a logistics provider)
## System Scenarios
The system scenarios describe essential technical functionalities that the system as a whole offers to achieve the goals (see goal section). For each goal at least one scenario has to be described. Create a subsection for each scenario and give each scenario a proper title.
### Sample Scenario
A scenario shall describe a sequence of interactions to achieve a certain goal. Clearly name the goal that is achieved in the introduction of the scenario. Describe the scenario as a list of numbered steps. The steps shall refer only to the elements that are part of the system architecture.
## Quality Requirements
This section shall list important quality requirements (also known as non-functional requirements) of the technical systems. The quality requirements shall focus on the overall technical system and shall not refer to technical details of a particular element. 
## Constraints
This section shall list important constraints for the technical systems. Constraints may include legal constraints (e.g. GPDR) or technical constraints (e.g. certain hardware or software)
